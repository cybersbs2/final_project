# final_project
It is still incomplete.
The patrol robot is made in Python. The robot used is Turtle Bot 3 Burger.
It will be operated in two ways. The first is patrol and the second is tracking.
We could not combine the two modes. You still have to run them individually.
It is an algorithm that traces a new object based on the map stored in the robot, and patrols until then.
Intruders use lidar to detect them. We are tracking the average value of newly created points.
The path planning was made using the A * algorithm and referenced to https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A*_search_algorithm.
